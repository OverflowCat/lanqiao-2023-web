Asynchronous JavaScript
In this module, we take a look at asynchronous JavaScript, why it is important, and how it can be used to effectively handle potential blocking operations, such as fetching resources from a server.

Looking to become a front-end web developer?
We have put together a course that includes all the essential information you need to work towards your goal.

Get started

Prerequisites
Asynchronous JavaScript is a fairly advanced topic, and you are advised to work through JavaScript first steps and JavaScript building blocks modules before attempting this.

Note: If you are working on a computer/tablet/other device where you don't have the ability to create your own files, you can try out (most of) the code examples in an online coding program such as JSBin or Glitch. ![](../images/25097972.png)

Guides
Introducing asynchronous JavaScript
In this article, we'll learn about synchronous and asynchronous programming, why we often need to use asynchronous techniques, and the problems related to the way asynchronous functions have historically been implemented in JavaScript.

How to use promises
Here we'll introduce promises and show how to use promise-based APIs. We'll also introduce the async and await keywords.

Implementing a promise-based API
This article will outline how to implement your own promise-based API.

Introducing workers
Workers enable you to run certain tasks in a separate thread to keep your main code responsive. In this article, we'll rewrite a long-running synchronous function to use a worker.

Assessments
Sequencing animations
The assessment asks you to use promises to play a set of animations in a particular sequence. ![](../images/13204777.png)
